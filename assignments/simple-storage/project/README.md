# Simple Storage Assignment

Implement `contracts/SimpleStorage.sol` so that all public tests pass. The contract requirements are in comments inside the stub.

## Quickstart

```bash
npm install
npx hardhat test              # public tests
# Maintainers only (uses hidden tests):
# npx hardhat test test hidden-tests
```
